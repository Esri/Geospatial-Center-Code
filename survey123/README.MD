### Forms Examples

`forms`

Survey123 [XLS](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/survey123/desktop/create-surveys/xlsformessentials.htm) form examples that highlight a pattern or contain interesting calculations.

For more information on getting started creating Forms with Survey123, view the documentation [here](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/survey123/desktop/create-surveys/createsurveys.htm).

### Custom JavaScript Functions

`javascript`

Starting with ArcGIS Survey123 version 3.10, you can incorporate logic in your forms using custom JavaScript (JS) functions. Custom JavaScript functions complement XLSForm expression syntax, giving you flexibility to build better calculations, data validation rules, constraints etc.
