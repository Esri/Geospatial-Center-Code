## Create Predominance Map with a lot of columns

Original Author: Bonnie Stayer

### Considerations:

I'd be particularly interested to see if someone has more clever way of addressing the highlighted step (how you get the column name back once you've got the highest value). That's the most cumbersome part, and you're actually returning hardcoded text rather than the real column name.
