# Geospatial-Center-Code

A repository for helpful scripts created by the Geospatial Center team (and others!). The Geospatial Center is a group of Solution Engineers across different teams within Esri. Through our day-to-day work, we often find ourselves creating helpful scripts for products across the ArcGIS software stack. This repo will hold those scripts as they become available.

## Contributing

**If you'd like to contribute, please follow the [example template](https://github.com/Esri/Geospatial-Center-Code/issues/2) for what files and details are needed.**

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a great IDE to use with strong and easy-to-use GitHub integration. Generally, you can follow this workflow for contributing using VSCode:

- In VSCode
  - Cloning the repo
    - Making a local copy of the repo on your machine
  - Creating a branch
    - You’ll make your changes/additions here first
  - Adding your script(s)
    - Literally creating folders/files for your scripts
  - Staging the changes
    - For example, if you have 10 files, but only want to add 3 of them, you would “stage” only those 3 files
  - Writing a commit message
    - A short descriptive message about what’s being added/changed
  - Committing your new additions to your new branch
    - Move your additions/changes from “staged” to “committed” in your branch only
  - Push changes to your new branch to the remote repo on Github.com
    - Send the additions/changes from your local machine to the remote repo on GH.com
    - This results in creating a remote version of your branch in the remote repo on GH.com
- On Github.com
  - Create a Pull Request (commonly referred to as a “PR”) to merge your new branch into the “master” branch
    - Create a request that will merge your branch into the “master” branch
    - Comments/discussion can happen around this pull request as needed
  - Merging your changes/additions into the master branch
    - This will merge your branch into the “master” branch and make your script available to all!
- Delete your local and remote branches
