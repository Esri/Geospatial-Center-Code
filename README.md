# Geospatial-Center-Code

A repository for helpful scripts created by the Geospatial Center team (and others!). The Geospatial Center is a group of Solution Engineers across different teams within Esri. Through our day-to-day work, we often find ourselves creating helpful scripts for products across the ArcGIS software stack. This repo will hold those scripts as they become available.
